# Minecraft-3JS 🧱🎮

A Minecraft clone built using Three.js, designed to showcase procedural world generation, player controls, and dynamic chunk loading. This project implements basic game mechanics like jumping, gravity, and block collision detection, all in a 3D environment. 🏞️

## Features ✨

- 🌍 **Infinite Procedural World Generation**: Generate a limitless world with chunks loaded dynamically as the player moves.
- 🕹️ **First-Person Player Controls**: Navigate through the world in first-person view with mouse and keyboard controls.
- ⬆️ **Jumping & Gravity**: The player can jump and experience gravity.
- 🛑 **Block Collision Detection**: Detect and prevent the player from moving through blocks.
- 👾 **Interaction with Villagers**: Trigger interactions with villagers using the 'F' key when near them.

## Technologies Used ⚙️

- **Three.js**: 3D rendering engine for creating the Minecraft-like world.
- **Pure TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for better maintainability and scalability.
- **WebGL**: Low-level API for rendering 3D graphics, used by Three.js for high-performance rendering.
